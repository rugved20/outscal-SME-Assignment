#Space Invaders games
I try to slove many of the errors from that game but unfortunately all the error are not reslove,so below there are some detail description about the bug that i have found in that game.
1)  Problem: Spaceship moves weirdly or doesn't listen to controls
   Possible Cause: Something might be wrong with how the game reads players movements.
   Fix: Look into how the game handles player's commands and make sure it's working smoothly.
2) Problem: Bullet vanish or dont hit enemies
   Possible Cause: The game might not be firing bullets correctly or noticing when they hit enemies.
   fix: Check how bullets are created and make sure they hit enemies like they should.
3) Problem: Enemies overlap or pass through each other:
    Possible Cause: The game might not be keeping track of where enemies are properly.
   Fix: Check how the game deals with enemies and make sure they stay seprate and dont go through each other.
   The above mentioned are the bugs and there fixes that i have observed in the game.
